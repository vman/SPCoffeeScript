CoffeeScript for SharePoint 2010

For now, You will need the Mindscape Web Workbench Visual Studio Extension which automatically converts CoffeeScript to JavaScript

Right now, the solution contains some samples in which I demonstrate how CoffeeScript can used on the SharePoint platform

jQuery 1.7.1 is included to demonstrate how CoffeeScript interacts with jQuery on SharePoint.
